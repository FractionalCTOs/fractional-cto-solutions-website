          Technical debt is like carbon monoxide - invisible, odorless, and deadly. By the time you notice the symptoms, you're already suffocating. Here's why your "quick fixes" are writing checks your future self can't cash.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The $2.4 Million Feature That Killed a Startup</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          True story: A startup needed a "simple" reporting feature. The CEO demanded it be done in two weeks for a big client demo. The developer said it needed six weeks to do right. They compromised on two weeks.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          That "simple" feature:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Crashed the production database 3 times</li>
          <li>Made page loads 10x slower</li>
          <li>Required 400 hours to refactor (6 months later)</li>
          <li>Lost them their biggest client</li>
          <li>Triggered a cascade of failures that killed the company</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Total cost of saving 4 weeks: $2.4 million and 37 jobs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">What Technical Debt Really Is</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          Technical debt isn't just "bad code." It's every decision that makes the next decision harder. It's compound interest on shortcuts. It's tomorrow's crisis hiding in today's "good enough."
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Technical Debt Equation:</h3>
          <p class="font-mono text-sm">
            Initial Shortcut Cost: $1,000 saved<br>
            Interest Rate: 15% per month (compound)<br>
            Time to Address: 12 months<br>
            <strong class="text-red-600">Final Cost: $5,350</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">And that's assuming nothing goes wrong. Something always goes wrong.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Four Horsemen of Technical Debt</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">1. The "Temporary" Fix</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          "We'll just hardcode this for now and fix it later." Later never comes. That hardcoded value becomes load-bearing. Six months later, changing it requires rewriting half your codebase.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Real Example:</p>
          <p>A "temporary" database connection string hardcoded in 2019. By 2024, it appeared in 847 files across 23 microservices. Migration cost: $180,000.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">2. The Copy-Paste Architecture</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Need similar functionality? Copy that file and change a few things. Now you have the same bug in 17 places. Fix it in one? Congrats, 16 bugs remain. And they're mutating.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">3. The "We Don't Need Tests" Sprint</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          "We're moving too fast for tests." Famous last words. Six months later, no one dares touch the code. Every change breaks three unrelated features. Your velocity isn't high - it's negative.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">4. The Dependency Jenga Tower</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          375 npm packages for a todo app. Half are deprecated. A quarter have security vulnerabilities. One breaks, everything falls. Updating means rewriting everything.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">How Technical Debt Compounds</h2>
        
        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-900">The Compound Effect Timeline:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> "This is a bit hacky, but it works!"</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> "Why does this simple change take 3 days?"</li>
            <li><strong>Month 6:</strong> "We can't add features until we refactor"</li>
            <li><strong>Month 9:</strong> "Our best developer just quit"</li>
            <li><strong>Month 12:</strong> "We need to rebuild from scratch"</li>
            <li><strong>Month 18:</strong> "Where did all our customers go?"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">Developer Morale Destruction</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Good developers don't quit jobs. They quit codebases. When every task is a battle against past decisions, your best people leave. The ones who stay? They're the ones who created the mess.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">Innovation Paralysis</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Want to add that game-changing feature? Sorry, the foundation can't support it. Your competitors launch new products while you're stuck maintaining Frankenstein's monster.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">Customer Trust Erosion</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Every bug, every crash, every "sorry, we can't do that" chips away at trust. Customers don't care about your technical debt. They care that your product gets worse over time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Right Way to Handle Technical Debt</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          Technical debt isn't always bad. Sometimes you need to move fast. The key is intentionality. Here's how winners do it:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Track it:</strong> Every shortcut gets a ticket with a cost estimate</li>
          <li><strong>Budget for it:</strong> 20% of development time for debt payment</li>
          <li><strong>Pay high-interest first:</strong> Security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks</li>
          <li><strong>Prevent it:</strong> Code reviews, architecture discussions, saying "no"</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate it:</strong> Business needs to understand the true cost</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The 20% Rule</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Successful companies allocate 20% of engineering time to technical debt reduction. Not 0% (debt grows). Not 50% (business stalls). 20% keeps the engine running while moving forward.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            Companies that follow this rule ship 3x faster after 12 months than those that don't.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">Questions Your CTO Should Answer</h2>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3">
          <li>What's our current technical debt load?</li>
          <li>Which debt has the highest interest rate?</li>
          <li>What's our payment plan?</li>
          <li>How are we preventing new debt?</li>
          <li>When do we say no to shortcuts?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-6">
          If they can't answer these, you don't have a CTO. You have a debt collector in disguise.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Bottom Line</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          Technical debt is like climate change for your codebase. Ignore it, and you'll face catastrophic failures. Acknowledge it, manage it, and you can build sustainably.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          The companies that survive understand this: Every line of code is either an asset or a liability. There's no neutral. And liabilities compound faster than assets appreciate.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-brand-dark text-white p-8 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Remember This</h3>
          <p class="text-lg mb-4">
            "Move fast and break things" works great. Until the things you break include your ability to move fast. Then you're just broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smart companies move fast AND build sustainably. It's not a tradeoff. It's a discipline.
          </p>
