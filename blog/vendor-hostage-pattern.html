          "We want to bring development in-house, but our vendor says it'll take 3-4 months and cost $75K to transition everything." The CEO was stunned. "We've paid them $400K over two years. Don't we own this?"
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Turns out: No. They didn't own any of it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Pattern: How It Happens</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          You hire a development shop. They're professional, responsive, and deliver on time. The application works great. Everything seems fine. Then one day you need to make a change—hire a new developer, switch vendors, or bring things in-house—and you discover the trap.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-900">What You Think You Own vs. What You Actually Control:</h3>
          <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
            <div>
              <p class="font-semibold mb-2">What's in the vendor's control:</p>
              <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
                <li>✗ AWS/Azure/GCP admin console</li>
                <li>✗ Production database</li>
                <li>✗ CI/CD pipeline</li>
                <li>✗ All API keys and secrets</li>
                <li>✗ Domain/SSL certificates</li>
                <li>✗ Monitoring and logs</li>
                <li>✗ Third-party service accounts</li>

            </div>
            <div>
              <p class="font-semibold mb-2">What you have access to:</p>
              <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
                <li>✓ Read-only GitHub access</li>

          When you finally decide to leave, here's what "transition" actually means:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-4 mb-8">
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">1.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Create new infrastructure from scratch</strong> - Can't just transfer their AWS account to you. Have to rebuild everything in your account. (4-6 weeks)
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">2.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Migrate the database</strong> - Export, test, verify, switch over. Hope nothing breaks. (2-3 weeks)

          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">3.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Recreate all API integrations</strong> - New keys, new webhooks, new service accounts. (1-2 weeks)
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">4.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Transfer the domain</strong> - Unlock, get auth codes, hope they cooperate. (1-2 weeks)
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">5.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Document everything they never documented</strong> - Figure out what they built and how it works. (Ongoing nightmare)
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Timeline if they cooperate:</p>
          <p class="mb-2">8-10 weeks, $50-75K in migration costs</p>
          <p class="font-semibold mb-2 mt-4">Timeline if they don't cooperate:</p>
          <p>3-4 months, $100K+, possible data loss, 2-4 weeks operational disruption</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">How This Should Have Been Set Up</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Professional development shops set things up the right way from day one. Here's what that looks like:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">1. Infrastructure in Your AWS/Azure/GCP Account</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The dev shop gets IAM roles to deploy and manage. You keep ownership. You pay the cloud bills directly. No markup, full transparency.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          <strong>Separation cost if this is done right:</strong> Remove their IAM access. Done. (5 minutes)
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">2. Repository in Your GitHub Organization</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Add dev shop team members as collaborators. They can commit and deploy. You can see everything. No "code handoff" needed later—you already have it.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          <strong>Separation cost if this is done right:</strong> Remove their collaborator access. Done. (2 minutes)
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">3. Third-Party Services in Your Name</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Stripe account? Your business entity. SendGrid? Your account. Google Analytics? Your property. The dev shop helps set them up, but they're registered to you.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          <strong>Separation cost if this is done right:</strong> Change who has admin access. Done. (30 minutes)
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Questions You Should Have Asked</h2>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 mb-8 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-semibold mb-4">Before you sign with a dev shop, ask:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-3">
            <li><strong>"Will the application run in my cloud account or yours?"</strong><br/>
            <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Good answer: "Yours." Bad answer: "Ours, for simplicity."</span></li>

            <li><strong>"Will I have admin access to everything from day one?"</strong><br/>
            <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Good answer: "Yes, we'll set up your admin account first." Bad answer: "You don't need that."</span></li>

            <li><strong>"If we part ways, what's involved in me taking over?"</strong><br/>
            <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Good answer: "Nothing, you already own it." Bad answer: "We'd need to migrate everything."</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">Why Dev Shops Do This</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          To be fair, it's not always malicious:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li><strong>Habit:</strong> "This is just how we've always done it"</li>
          <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Easier to use their existing accounts and infrastructure</li>
          <li><strong>Control:</strong> Prevents clients from accidentally breaking things</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Cloud markup and guaranteed ongoing engagement</li>
          <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Makes it harder for you to leave</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-6">
          But regardless of intent, the result is the same: You're locked in.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">If You're Already Locked In</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Found yourself in this situation? Here's what to do:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
          <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-brand-red p-4">
            <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Option 1: Negotiate a transition</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Budget 8-10 weeks and $50-75K. Get it in writing. Expect it to take longer.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-brand-red p-4">
            <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Option 2: Gradual migration</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Set up new infrastructure alongside old. Migrate piece by piece. Slower but less risky.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-brand-red p-4">
            <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Option 3: Accept the relationship</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">If they're good and prices are fair, sometimes the devil you know is better than the migration nightmare.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          You can't manage what you don't control. You can't control what you don't own.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          If your vendor relationship ended tomorrow—amicably or otherwise—could you:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-8">
          <li>• Deploy an update to your application?</li>
          <li>• Access your production database?</li>
          <li>• Renew your SSL certificate?</li>
          <li>• View your application logs?</li>
          <li>• Hire a new developer and give them access?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-8">
          If the answer to any of these is "no" or "I think so, maybe?" you're in the hostage pattern.
        </p>
