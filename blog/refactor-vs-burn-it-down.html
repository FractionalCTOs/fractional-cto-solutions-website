          "This codebase is unmaintainable. We need to rewrite it." Your lead developer drops this bomb in a planning meeting. Six months and $200K to rebuild everything. Or you could spend the next year gradually refactoring. Which is the right call?
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          The rewrite vs. refactor decision is one of the most expensive bets you'll make. Get it wrong and you'll burn months and hundreds of thousands of dollars—either on a failed rewrite or on endlessly polishing a codebase that should have been replaced.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
          Here's how to make the call.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Rewrite Seduction</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Rewrites are seductive. Everything will be clean. No more hacks. No more technical debt. Modern architecture. The new framework everyone's excited about. It's going to be <em>perfect</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Except:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-900">Why Rewrites Usually Fail:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>1. You underestimate the scope.</strong> That "simple" feature took 3 days originally because of 10 edge cases you forgot existed. You'll rediscover them all.</li>
            <li><strong>2. The world doesn't stop.</strong> While you rebuild, your competitors ship features. Customers still need bug fixes. You're building for yesterday's requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>3. You lose all the learned knowledge.</strong> That weird workaround in the old code? It's there for a reason you'll rediscover the hard way.</li>
            <li><strong>4. You recreate the same problems.</strong> Without understanding why the old code got messy, you'll make the same mistakes in the new code.</li>
            <li><strong>5. The timeline estimate is always wrong.</strong> "Six months" becomes twelve months becomes eighteen months. Revenue suffers while you rebuild.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Netscape famously rewrote their browser from scratch. It took three years. By the time they shipped, Internet Explorer had won the browser wars. The rewrite killed the company.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
          But sometimes, a rewrite IS the right answer. The question is: when?
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">Refactor: The Case for Incremental Improvement</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Refactoring means cleaning up code without changing what it does. You improve structure, readability, and maintainability while keeping the system running.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 mb-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-900">Advantages of Refactoring:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li>✓ <strong>Lower risk:</strong> Change one piece at a time. If something breaks, rollback is easy.</li>
            <li>✓ <strong>Continuous delivery:</strong> You're shipping features while improving code quality.</li>
            <li>✓ <strong>Learn as you go:</strong> Each refactor teaches you more about the system.</li>
            <li>✓ <strong>Incremental cost:</strong> 20% overhead on each feature vs. 6-month development freeze.</li>
            <li>✓ <strong>Preserve institutional knowledge:</strong> All those edge cases stay handled.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-6">
          The best refactoring is invisible. Users don't notice. The business keeps moving. Code quality improves week by week.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 mb-8 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-semibold mb-3">The Boy Scout Rule:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            "Leave the code better than you found it." Every time you touch a file, improve something small. Over time, the codebase gets better without a dedicated refactoring project.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Decision Framework</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Use this framework to decide: refactor or rewrite?
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">Lean Toward Refactoring If:</h3>

        <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 mb-6 rounded-lg">
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li>✓ The code works and has paying customers</li>
            <li>✓ The problems are localized to specific modules</li>
            <li>✓ You can identify what needs fixing</li>
            <li>✓ The core architecture is sound, just messy</li>
            <li>✓ You're still actively shipping features</li>
            <li>✓ The existing tech stack is modern enough</li>
            <li>✓ Your team understands the codebase</li>
            <li>✓ Business can tolerate slower feature velocity temporarily</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">Consider Rewriting If:</h3>

        <div class="bg-orange-50 p-6 mb-8 rounded-lg">
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li>• The technology is obsolete (PHP 4, IE6-era JavaScript, etc.)</li>
            <li>• Fundamental architecture problems (wrong database, wrong paradigm)</li>
            <li>• Security vulnerabilities are systemic, not patchable</li>
            <li>• It's cheaper to rebuild than to refactor (rare but real)</li>
            <li>• The entire codebase was written by someone who didn't know the language</li>
            <li>• Literally nobody understands how it works anymore</li>
            <li>• You're changing the entire business model and code can't adapt</li>
            <li>• Maintenance cost > rebuild cost (proven, not guessed)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Strangler Pattern: The Best of Both Worlds</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          There's a third option: gradually replace the old system with a new one, piece by piece.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 mb-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">How the Strangler Pattern Works:</h3>
          <ol class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>1. Build new functionality alongside the old</strong> - Don't touch the old code yet</li>
            <li><strong>2. Route new features to the new system</strong> - Gradually direct traffic to new code</li>
            <li><strong>3. Migrate old features one at a time</strong> - When you need to change something, rewrite that piece</li>
            <li><strong>4. Eventually the old system withers</strong> - Over 12-18 months, the old code shrinks to zero</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-6">
          This is how Amazon, Netflix, and other tech giants modernize legacy systems. It's lower risk than a big-bang rewrite and faster than pure refactoring.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 mb-8 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-600">
          <p class="font-semibold mb-3">Real Example:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            A client had a legacy .NET app. Instead of a 9-month rewrite, we:
          </p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
            <li>• Built new features in Node.js + React</li>
            <li>• Proxy routed between old and new systems</li>
            <li>• Migrated one module per sprint</li>
            <li>• After 14 months, the old system was gone</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Result:</strong> Zero downtime, continuous feature delivery, incremental cost instead of massive upfront investment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">Red Flags: When Your Developer Just Wants a Rewrite</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Sometimes "we need to rewrite" is code for "I don't want to work on this anymore." Watch for these red flags:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Signs It's Not About the Code:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>✗ "This code is trash" but can't explain specific problems</li>
            <li>✗ They want to use the hot new framework they've been excited about</li>
            <li>✗ They just joined and haven't tried to understand the existing system</li>
            <li>✗ "Everything needs to be rebuilt" (nothing is ever 100% unfixable)</li>
            <li>✗ They're bored with maintenance and want greenfield work</li>
            <li>✗ Can't answer "what's the business case for this investment?"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-8">
          A rewrite is a business decision, not a developer preference decision. If they can't articulate business value, push back.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Real Cost of Rewrites</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Let's say your developer estimates 6 months for a rewrite. Here's the actual cost:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 mb-8 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-semibold mb-4">Conservative Rewrite Cost Breakdown:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>Direct development cost:</strong> 6 months × $10K-15K/month = $60K-90K</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> Features you didn't ship = 3-6 months behind competitors</li>
            <li><strong>Bug fixes you can't do:</strong> Customer frustration + churn</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline overrun (happens 90% of the time):</strong> +3-6 months = +$30K-90K</li>
            <li><strong>Post-launch bug fixing:</strong> New code = new bugs = 2-3 months stabilization</li>
            <li><strong>Lost revenue during transition:</strong> Varies, but rarely zero</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Total Real Cost: $150K-300K+ and 12-18 months</p>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-8">
          Compare that to refactoring: 20% overhead on ongoing development, spread over 12 months, while still shipping features.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">Questions to Ask Before Approving a Rewrite</h2>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 mb-8 rounded-lg">
          <ul class="space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>"What specific problem does this solve that refactoring can't?"</strong><br/>
              <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">If they can't articulate this clearly, it's not a real rewrite need.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"What's the cost if we don't do this at all?"</strong><br/>
              <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Sometimes the answer is "we'll be fine." That's important to know.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Can we do this incrementally instead?"</strong><br/>
              <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Strangler pattern almost always works. Push for this option first.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"What features will we NOT ship during the rewrite?"</strong><br/>
              <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Opportunity cost is real. Quantify it.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"How will we avoid making the same mistakes in the new code?"</strong><br/>
              <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">If they don't have a good answer, the rewrite will get messy too.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">When a Rewrite Actually Makes Sense</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Sometimes it really is the right call. Real examples where rewriting was correct:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-4 mb-8">
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">1.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Legacy PHP 5.3 app, hosting provider dropping support.</strong> Couldn't run modern frameworks. Upgrade path was basically a rewrite anyway.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">2.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Monolith hitting fundamental scalability limits.</strong> Database couldn't handle load even with optimizations. Architecture needed to change.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">3.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Offshore team built unmaintainable mess, then disappeared.</strong> No documentation, no handoff. Reverse engineering cost more than starting fresh.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-brand-red font-bold mr-3">4.</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Business pivot required completely different data model.</strong> Old code couldn't adapt. Would've been 80% rewritten through refactoring anyway.
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-8">
          Notice the pattern? These were forced rewrites, not voluntary ones. The old system couldn't continue for technical or business reasons.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Refactoring is almost always the right answer. It's lower risk, delivers continuous value, and costs less.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Rewrites are seductive but dangerous. They take longer than estimated, cost more than projected, and often recreate the same problems in new forms.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          The Strangler Pattern is the best compromise: gradually replace the old system while continuing to ship features and generate revenue.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
          When in doubt: refactor. You can always escalate to a rewrite later if refactoring isn't working. But you can't undo a failed rewrite.
        </p>
