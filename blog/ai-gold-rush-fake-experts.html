        <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Serial "Expert" Evolution:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 font-mono text-sm">
            <li>2017-2018: "Cryptocurrency Consultant"</li>
            <li>2019-2020: "Blockchain Solutions Architect"</li>

          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">Same resume. Same lack of actual building. Different buzzwords.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">Why This Matters More Than Ever</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          Unlike blockchain's speculative bubble, AI is eating real businesses right now. When a fake blockchain expert fails, you lose some cryptocurrency. When a fake AI expert fails, you lose your competitive advantage, customer data, and possibly your entire business.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          The stakes have never been higher, and the fakes have never been more dangerous.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Anatomy of a Fake AI Expert</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">1. The ChatGPT Wrapper</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Their "revolutionary AI solution" is literally just ChatGPT with a different logo. They discovered API calls last month and now they're "AI architects." Their entire expertise is prompt engineering, which is like calling yourself a chef because you can order from DoorDash.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Red Flag Phrases:</h4>
          <ul class="space-y-1 text-gray-700">
            <li>• "We leverage cutting-edge LLMs" (translation: we use ChatGPT)</li>
            <li>• "Our proprietary AI technology" (translation: we wrote 10 lines of Python)</li>
            <li>• "AI-powered solution" (translation: we added a chatbot)</li>
            <li>• "Next-generation neural networks" (translation: we have no idea what we're saying)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">2. The Certification Collector</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          They've got 47 AI certifications from platforms you've never heard of. Each one took 2 hours and $49 to obtain. They list "Certified AI Professional" like it means something, but they can't explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-brand-dark">3. The Buzzword Bingo Champion</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Their LinkedIn posts are word salads of AI terms: "Leveraging synergistic neural architectures for quantum-enhanced deep learning optimization." Impressive? No. It's gibberish. Real experts explain complex things simply. Fakes make simple things sound complex.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">Questions That Expose Fake AI Expertise</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          Want to separate wheat from chaff? Ask these questions:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-8 space-y-4">
          <li>
            <strong>"What's the difference between gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent?"</strong><br>
            <span class="text-gray-600">Basic ML knowledge. Fakes will word-salad their way around this.</span>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>"How do you handle overfitting in production models?"</strong><br>
            <span class="text-gray-600">Real practitioners have war stories. Fakes mention "regularization" and hope you don't dig deeper.</span>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>"What's your approach to data privacy in AI implementations?"</strong><br>
            <span class="text-gray-600">Experts discuss differential privacy, federated learning, GDPR implications. Fakes say "we take privacy seriously."</span>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>"Tell me about a time your AI model failed in production."</strong><br>
            <span class="text-gray-600">Everyone who's built real AI has failure stories. Fakes claim perfection.</span>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>"What's the computational cost of your solution?"</strong><br>
            <span class="text-gray-600">Real builders know their GPU hours and API costs. Fakes haven't thought about it.</span>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The "Build a Chatbot, Become an Expert" Pipeline</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          Here's how someone becomes an "AI expert" in 2025:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Watch 3 YouTube tutorials on ChatGPT API</li>
            <li>Build a basic chatbot using copy-pasted code</li>
            <li>Update LinkedIn title to "AI Solutions Architect"</li>
            <li>Post daily about "revolutionizing industries with AI"</li>
            <li>Charge $10,000 for a $50 API integration</li>
            <li>Fail spectacularly when asked to do anything custom</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">What Real AI Expertise Looks Like</h2>
        
        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-8">
          <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-900">Fake AI "Experts"</h3>
            <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>✗ Everything is "revolutionary"</li>
              <li>✗ Can't code beyond copy-paste</li>

          <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">

              <li>✓ Emphasize data quality</li>
              <li>✓ Know when NOT to use AI</li>
              <li>✓ Battle scars from production</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Danger of AI Snake Oil</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          When fake experts sell AI solutions, here's what happens:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Data breaches:</strong> They pipe your customer data through public APIs</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance nightmares:</strong> GDPR? CCPA? Never heard of them</li>
          <li><strong>Hallucination disasters:</strong> Their bot tells customers complete lies</li>
          <li><strong>Astronomical costs:</strong> $10,000/month in API fees for 100 users</li>
          <li><strong>Unmaintainable code:</strong> Copy-pasted spaghetti that no one understands</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-900">A Real-World Disaster</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            A company hired an "AI expert" who promised to "revolutionize customer service." The result:
          </p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>• Chatbot told customers to "kill themselves" when frustrated</li>
            <li>• Leaked 50,000 customer records through prompt injection</li>
            <li>• $30,000/month in OpenAI fees for basic queries</li>
            <li>• Complete system rebuilt by actual experts: $200,000</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">How to Protect Your Business</h2>
        
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Check their GitHub:</strong> Real builders have code. Fakes have marketing.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask about failures:</strong> Experience includes failures. Fakes claim only wins.</li>
          <li><strong>Demand specifics:</strong> Architecture diagrams, cost projections, scaling plans.</li>
          <li><strong>Test their knowledge:</strong> Basic technical questions reveal everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Look for depth:</strong> Did they just discover AI, or have they been building for years?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-brand-dark">The Bottom Line</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          The AI gold rush is real, but so are the claim jumpers. For every legitimate expert, there are 50 opportunists who smell money and updated their LinkedIn profile accordingly.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Your business can't afford to be their learning experience. When someone promises AI magic, ask yourself: Were they solving complex problems before AI was cool, or did they just arrive on the bandwagon?
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Real expertise doesn't appear overnight. It's built through years of wrestling with data, debugging models, and learning why the elegant solution in the research paper fails spectacularly in production.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-brand-dark text-white p-8 rounded-xl mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Remember This</h3>
          <p class="text-lg">
            The same people selling you "revolutionary AI solutions" today were selling "revolutionary blockchain solutions" three years ago. They'll be selling "revolutionary quantum solutions" three years from now. The buzzwords change. The lack of substance doesn't.
